							The <strong>Milwaukee Brewers</strong> are a professional
							baseball team based in <strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>.
						<p>
							The team is a member of the <strong>Central Division</strong> of
							Major League Baseball's NL and plays its home games at <strong>Miller
								Park</strong>.
						<p>
							Originating in <strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>, as the
							Seattle Pilots, the club played for one season in <strong>1969</strong>
							before being acquired in bankruptcy court by current MLB
							Commissioner <strong>Bud Selig</strong> and then moved to
							Milwaukee.
						<p>The Brewers were part of the American League from their
							creation as an expansion club in 1969 through the 1997 season,
							after which they moved to the National League Central Division.
							Milwaukee had previously been a National League city when its
							team was the Milwaukee Braves (1953-1965).
						<p>
							In 1982, Milwaukee won the American League East Division and the
							<strong>American League Pennant</strong>, earning their only
							World Series appearance to date. In the Series, they lost to the
							St. Louis Cardinals, four games to three.
